# Solenoid — Architecture & File Map

Living document, kept at **module granularity** (one line per concern, not one
line per node file — there are ~300 of those and the registry is the real
index). Update when a new module or concern lands, in the same commit.

Mechanics and gotchas live in `docs/subsystem-invariants.md`; rulings in
`docs/decisions.md` and `docs/rules.md`; the running log in `docs/dev-notes.md`.
This file is the map.

## Stack

- **View layer**: React Flow (`@xyflow/react`) — the ONE renderer. Cards, cables,
  minimap, viewport all render in the app's single React tree.
- **Model/compute spine**: rete core (`rete` — NodeEditor + ClassicPreset, headless)
  + `rete-engine` (DataflowEngine, pull-based recompute). No rete render/area
  plugins exist; `elkjs` is called directly for Tidy. The core stays on purpose
  (decisions reactFlowView — author-ratified 2026-08-27).
- **UI**: React + Vite, desktop shell via Tauri. Math helpers: formulajs,
  KaTeX (formula popup), marked (help panel).
- Cross-surface state stays in module-level singleton stores (`storeKit.ts`
  pattern) read via `useSyncExternalStore` — they predate the single tree and
  remain the app-state convention.

```

### Engine / core (`src/graph/`)

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `process.ts` | The app's recompute ONLY: the MAIN `_editor/_engine/_area` refs, the graph-rebuild guard, `processGraph()` (the `graphCompute` pass + targeted re-render, cable values, perf, the compute overlay, calc mode), recalc generation (volatile nodes), `bulkSettle`. **STAYS MAIN-ONLY** (persistence/serialize read it) |
| `graphCompute.ts` | THE model-level pass, one definition for every caller (rules targetedEqualsFull): `loopMembers` (Tarjan SCC), `downstreamClosure`, `invalidate` (cone or full), `seedLoopErrors` (`#CIRC!` cache + value-box seeding), `fetchAll`, `computeAll`. Used by `processGraph`, the composite's internal engine, `scripts/run-graph.ts` and the seed tests |
| `canvasCommands.ts` | The chrome → surface command slots (select/unselect, Tidy/Cleanup, delete, dock reposition, clear history) the mounted FlowSurface registers and the drill-in swaps (`swapSelectionSlots`/`swapArrangeSlots`) |
| `seedStore.ts`, `graphSignals.ts`, `ctorProvider.ts` | Seed selection (`custom` once edited) + the load slot; the tiny version/flag stores cards subscribe to (connection version, cable-drag, conduit angle); the ctor-registry provider copyPaste reads (a cycle-breaker) |
| `activeGraph.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | The canvas-substitution SEAM: `setActiveGraph(ctx\|null)` registers a substituting surface (composite drill-in), `getActive*`/`getOwningEditor` resolve override-else-main. Chrome/actions read these so a drill-in is first-class; `getEditor()`/persistence stay MAIN (locked by the test). Register on mount / clear on unmount; nested surfaces REPLACE (breadcrumb stack lives in compositeEditorStore) |
| `viewPresets.ts` | The pure zoom module both surfaces share: `MIN_ZOOM`/`MAX_ZOOM`, `clampZoom`, `wheelZoomDelta` (the proportional wheel curve — px slope, step cap, line/page normalization) |
| `view.ts` | THE canvas-view seam, `View`: what model-side code may ask of the view — `position(id)`/`nodeElement(id)`/`connectionElement(id)`/`hasNode(id)` (position reads `node.position`, the model's one source of truth; elements resolve to the live RF DOM per call), `container`/`viewport`, the camera (`transform`, `zoom`, `pan`), `moveNode`, `rerenderNode`/`rerenderCables`, `onRender`, `measured`; `flow/flowView.ts` is the one implementation |
| `zoomAt.ts` | Frame a node set over a `Pick` of the `View` seam (`ZoomView`): RF's `getNodesBounds` + `getViewportForBounds` (padding 0.1, never zooms IN past 1), zoom floored to the snap step |
| `schemes.ts` | Rete scheme types (`SolenoidConnection` must use `ClassicPreset.Node` — variance) |
| `rete-nodes.ts` | Node class re-exports for the editor |
| `nodeRegistry.ts` | `NODE_COMPONENTS`: `[Ctor, Component]` rows — the one place a node binds its React component |
| `coerceInputs.ts` | `nodecreated` pipe wrapping every `data()` — normalizes incoming shapes to the socket's declared type (`#SHAPE!` on coercion failure); widens scalar/list/matrix → `frame` (list = ROW), bridges logical↔number. Per-input policy: a node lists `rawInputs` (a `ReadonlySet<string>`) to receive an input UNCOERCED and branch on the runtime shape itself (XLOOKUP's `frame` — a polymorphic frame-or-cube source); ACCEPTANCE stays lattice-driven, COERCION is the node's call |
| `persistence.ts` (+`persistenceCore.ts`) | JSON save/load (format v2), localStorage autosave, export/import; ctor lookup derived from the catalog; `rebuildGraph` one-commit rebuild behind the load curtain. ORDER MATTERS in the rebuild tail: `settleWildcardTypes` runs BEFORE the FC dock loop (waitForTypeSettle, pinned by `fcDockReload.test.ts`). `persistenceCore` holds the pure validate/version helpers (`validateSavedGraph`, `CURRENT_SAVE_VERSION`) |
| `loadReveal.ts`, `components/LoadOverlay.tsx` | The load-curtain store (idle/building + progress) + the build-phase progress overlay |
| `copyPaste.ts` (+`clipboard.ts`) | Ctrl+C/V with topology, id remap (own `cloneNode`/`pasteClipboard` path); ALSO the home of `extractInit`/`INIT_FIELD_ORDER` — imported by persistence/aiGrounding/composite; `clipboard.ts` is the execCommand-fallback text copy |
| `nodeCtorRegistry.ts` | The ctor lookup, DERIVED from the catalog (calls every `FLAT_CATALOG` factory, keys by `ctor.name`) — what persistence resolves types through |
| `documentStore.ts` (+`documentStoreCore.ts`) | Multi-document library: current doc + open tabs; per-doc autosave as ONE two-slot pair per doc id (`solenoid.docs.doc.<id>.a/.b`) plus a light two-slot index, object-identity change-detection so an unchanged doc costs zero serialization (`documentStorePersist.test.ts`); `documentStoreCore` holds the pure validate/transform helpers |
| `textForm.ts` | The addressable model's text projection: pure `SavedGraph ↔ text` (one node per line, topological + alphabetical-tie order, name-addressed connections); `serializeGraph`'s JSON is generated by round-tripping through it, not hand-maintained; robustness fuzzed in `textFormFuzz.test.ts` (clean rejection or round-trip closure, never a hang) |
| `graphValidate.ts` | The STRICT validating reader (aiInScope/aiWholeDocRewrite pre-apply gate): every silently-repaired load condition is a repair-grade, line-anchored issue; op values checked against `opVocab.ts`; recurses into composite internals; cycles are warnings. False-positive guards: the seeds + whole-catalog sweeps in its test |
| `opVocab.ts` | Per-class `op=` vocabulary (NODE_OPS + catalog leaves + hiddenOps + the dropdown-only aggregate families); shared by the validator and the grounding spec |
| `aiGrounding.ts` | The model-facing authoring spec, GENERATED from the catalog + live classes (grammar, socket lattice, per-class init/inline/ops); cached per session as the AI system prompt |
| `aiService.ts` (+`aiKey.ts`, `apiKeyStore.ts`, `aiDemo.ts`, `aiReveal.ts`) | The AI palette's loop: prompt + current text form → `claude-opus-5` (SDK, browser opt-in, user's key) → prose answer or fenced full rewrite, validator-gated with repair rounds; canonicalized for the diff; `aiDemo.ts` fakes the transport for the keyless demo, `aiReveal.ts` animates AI-added nodes, `apiKeyStore.ts` holds the device-local keys |
| `textDiff.ts` | Pure LCS line diff for the AI apply-approval view |
| `nodeNameStore.ts`, `nodeNaming.ts`, `nodeNames.ts` | The addressable model's other half: every node's stable, user-editable, unique `name` (separate from rete's regenerated-on-load `id`); `nodeNames.ts` derives live display names + endpoints for the connection dialog |
| `docMetaStore.ts` | Per-document metadata (F-2): author + tags → `SavedGraph.meta`, sidecar-carried; the Document Properties modal open flag (`docPropertiesPanel`). Title stays the documentStore name |
| `seeds.ts` + `seedGraphs/*.json` (+`seedTune.ts`) | Example graphs in Export format, globbed into a registry; `seedTune.ts` is the console-only live group-fit tuner `scripts/tune-seeds.mjs` drives |
| `flow/flowModel.ts` (+`.test.ts`, `flowModelEdit.test.ts`) | The headless graph model builder (real NodeEditor + DataflowEngine + coercion + guards, no view), its edit verbs (`connect`/`disconnect`/`addNode`/`removeNodes`/`moveNode` under the lattice) + the RF projections `toFlowNodes`/`toFlowEdges` (plain RF-shaped objects, no @xyflow import — node-vitest-testable): a group member projects as an RF child (`parentId`, position relative to the group, parents first), `toFlowPosition`/`fromFlowPosition` convert at the boundary, `nodeZIndex` (groups −2 < conduits −1 < nodes 0) |
| `flow/FlowSurface.tsx` | THE surface, shared by the main canvas and the drill-in: the RF element + identity-preserving `syncTopology`, handler binding, gesture installers, lasso, the socket/cable/node context menus, canvas keyboard, add menu (quick-wire), FC docking on drop, standoff tow (RF tows group members itself), RF-driven Delete (`onBeforeDelete`), selection mirror (`useOnSelectionChange`), right-click routing (`onNode/Edge/PaneContextMenu`), snapToGrid, isolate, touch select, RF `<MiniMap>`, `StandoffLayer` (hosts opting in), `HtmlCanvasLayer`, `CableInspector`. Takes a `SurfaceStack` + `SurfaceHooks` |
| `flow/FlowCanvas.tsx` | The main host: app-lifetime stack (editor + engine + flowView + rebuild-aware topology pipe), the canvasCommands slot registrations, cable-change pipe, document restore, autosave + snapshot history hooks, and the app chrome rendered BESIDE the surface (palette, toasts, dialogs, legend, load/compute overlays) so it stays visible under a drill-in |
| `flow/flowView.ts` | `makeFlowView` — the ONE `View` implementation: the seam's verbs become RF state via late-bound callbacks; `position(id)` reads/writes `node.position` on the editor's nodes, `nodeElement`/`connectionElement` resolve the live RF DOM per call; the surface writes back camera/pointer/measured sizes through the `FlowView` half |
| `flow/SolNodeAdapter.tsx` + `flow/SolFlowNode.tsx` | The RF node type: adapts a rete node instance to the registered card component (version-bumped re-renders, ErrorBoundary per card) |
| `flow/FlowCableEdge.tsx` | The cable renderer (RF edge type; paths from `cablePaths.ts`, visible strokes as `<BaseEdge>`s styled inline, ribbons, run selection, hit path `.solenoid-cable-hit`) |
| `flow/FlowConnectionLine.tsx` | The cable being DRAGGED from a socket (RF `connectionLineComponent`): same router + type color as a live cable |
| `flow/FlowSocketHandle.tsx` | The RF `<Handle>` each socket renders through (measurement + cable anchoring); lights the socket a dragged cable would land on (`useConnection`) |
| `flow/FlowResizeGrip.tsx` | The corner resize grip: RF `NodeResizeControl` wearing the app's grip mark; the model keeps the size (FlowSurface drops the resizer's own dimension changes) |
| `flowSurface.ts` | The injection seam: node components ask for the RF `Handle` (`useFlowSocket`) and the resize grip (`useFlowResizeGrip`); the flow chunk injects both so shared component code never imports @xyflow/react |
| `flow/flowPinch.ts`, `flow/flowTouchPan.ts`, `flow/flowWheel.ts` | The gesture installers both surfaces wire (see subsystem-invariants § Pointer gestures) |
| `flow/flowHistory.ts` + `flow/flowHistoryDigest.ts` (+tests) | Snapshot undo — THE undo: debounced full-graph snapshots + `describeGraphDelta` labels |
| `flow/FlowCompositeOverlay.tsx` | The drill-in host: a `FlowSurface` over the composite internal editor plus the breadcrumb strip, port promotion, run controls and the per-composite snapshot history; registers the active graph and swaps the select / arrange slots while open (see subsystem-invariants § Composite drill-in mount lifecycle) |
| `flow/StaticFlowStage.tsx` | Non-interactive RF stage (landing demo, node showcase): `makeStaticStack` + controlled viewport |
| `flow/flowSeeds.ts`, `flow/preview.ts` | Own seed glob (no persistence import — headless-harness-safe); generic-card value previews |
| `canvasKeyboard.ts` | `installCanvasKeyboard(deps)` — the whole keyboard map (single-key graph actions, Ctrl chords, F9, arrows/nudge, rotate, Tab chrome toggle) + its helpers (resolveGroupTargets, rotateSelection, nudgeSelection) |
| `modalGuard.ts` | `modalOwnsKeyboard()` — the one gate every canvas-level key handler (canvasKeyboard, the surface's Escape, RF's delete hook) asks first: an `aria-modal` dialog / pop-up overlay in the DOM, or an open palette / reference / settings / shortcuts, and the canvas shortcuts stand down (F9 excepted) |
| `canvasLasso.ts` | `installLassoSelection(deps)` — shift-drag / touch-select lasso: winding-direction touch vs enclose modes, cached node rects, frame-coalesced live apply, release-time cable path sampling |
| `canvasContextMenu.ts` | Right-click TARGET resolvers behind RF's node/edge/pane handlers: socket (with near-miss radius), cable (ribbon/selection expansion), node body (pin/standoff offers) |
| `canvasActions.ts` | The graph actions those menus/keys invoke: `deleteSelection` (ghost-splicing bulk delete), `insertConduitForCables` (lane-bundled Conduit splice), `linkStandoffBetween`, `deleteCables`, `attachFormatController` |
| `canvasGeometry.ts` | Screen ↔ canvas coordinate helpers (`getSocketScreenCenter`, `screenToCanvas`) shared by FC docking + quick-wire placement |
| `fcDocking.ts` | FC docking: `findDockTarget` (canvas-unit snap), `computeDockedCanvasPos`/`dockedRenderedDims`, and the inline splice/unsplice (`insertFcInline`/`removeFcInline`) |
| `tidyArrange.ts` | Tidy + Cleanup: `makeEnsureElk` (lazy elkjs), `elkTidyLayout` (the direct ELK call — symmetric FIXED_POS ports, port-id edges), `makeArrangeFn` (the group/standoff/docked-FC-aware layout — see subsystem-invariants "Auto-arrange / Tidy"), `makeCleanupFn` |
| `storeKit.ts` | The module-singleton store kit (`createNotifier` / `createToggleStore` / `createValueStore`) every app-wide store builds on (see Conventions) |
| `pointerGesture.ts` | THE two-finger gesture definition: window-capture contact census, `isPinching()` (≥2 fingers) — what the pinch-priority rule stands on |
| `historyDigest.ts` | Human-readable session-history text (`digestLabeled` over flowHistory's labeled records) |
| `modelFuzz.ts` | Model fuzzing: valid-shaped inputs per typed leaf source, driven through targeted recompute; findings land in the Problems panel (origin "fuzz") |
| `imageAssets.ts` | Desktop image persistence: a node's session `dataUrl` becomes a plain file in `images/` beside the doc (`assetPath`), so saves never carry base64 |
| `fileSession.ts` | Disk save/open: native dialogs on desktop, download / file-input on web; a path-bound doc saves through documentStore |
| `saveTimeStore.ts` | The save-clock read seam (per-doc autosave + file-save stamps) documentStore injects, since node classes can't import it |
| `noteFrontmatterSync.ts` | THE one cable-drop for cables stranded by a frontmatter re-sync (Note on-blur commit + Import file-load share it) |
| `noteInlineRefs.ts` | Note-body `` `=name` `` refs → minted INPUT sockets (Expression's identifier grammar; trailing `!` is display-only) |
| `reportStore.ts` + `reportExport.ts` | Report chrome seam (open/docked state) and the static HTML export (document-valued refs render as embed blocks) |

### Typing / sockets / units

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `sockets.ts` | `SocketDataType` + `SOCKET_COLORS` (CSS vars, incl. purple = logical); `FAMILIES` (element × dim lattice) DERIVES `SOCKET_ACCEPTS`; `accepts`/`areCompatible`/`canConnect`. Governing rule: enforce TYPE separation (Cast to cross families; only logical↔number bridges), allow DIMENSIONAL flow (scalar→list→matrix→frame); `anytable`/`frame` widen from lower rank. The wildcard ladder (wildcardLadder): `any` = untyped SCALAR, `anycombo` = 0-or-1-D, `anylist`/`anytable` = 1-D/2-D, `anydata` = rank ≤ 2 (matricesInFormulas), `trueany` = the adopt-anything supremum (hollow ring; `AdoptiveSocket`/`MutableSocket`, `isWildcardType`) |
| `valueKinds.ts` | First-class value-model kinds: `null` (missing), logical (boolean), Kleene 3-valued logic helpers; aggregators skip null / propagate `SolError` |
| `errorValue.ts` | Tagged `SolError` values (Excel-style `#CODE!`); `installErrorGuards(node)` wraps every `data()` at `nodecreated` (error in → error out); `withOrigin`/`SolErrorOrigin` stamp the FIRST mint site (nodeId/name, row index for list/frame cells) so a chain of passthroughs still points at the true source; `registerErrorSink` is the seam the Problems panel taps (reports `null` on a clean pass so a relapse re-fires) |
| `nodeStoreRegistry.ts` | The forget seam: any node-keyed module store (collapse, manual size, cable values, socket angles…) calls `registerNodeForget(fn)` once; `forgetNode(id)` runs from the `noderemoved` pipe AND the bulk-delete path (`canvasActions`), so a deleted node's entries don't leak — a new store never threads its own cleanup |
| `flyToNode.ts` | Pan/zoom the viewport to center one or more nodes (expanding a collapsed host group first) — the shared "go to this node" action behind the pins HUD, alerts HUD, popup "Go to node" buttons, and Presentation's per-step camera fly |
| `nodes/kind.ts` | node → `NodeKind` CLASSIFIER (`nodeKindOf`) + per-kind weights/resizable/wide flags; the kind → accent map (`NODE_KIND_ACCENTS`) lives in `nodes/shared.ts` |
| `dimension.ts` | Dimensional algebra — the pure, graph-free units foundation (dimension vectors, multiply/divide/power, commensurability) |
| `unitValue.ts` | The unit-on-the-VALUE layer (FC A4): `UnitCell` (base-SI magnitude + display id), mirrors `valueKinds.ts`'s shape; `applyFcUnit` lives at this seam via `unitBridge` |
| `unitDimExpr.ts` + `unitLattice.ts` | Unit-expression algebra (compound unit spellings) + the unit compatibility lattice |
| `unitBridge.ts` | The unit-blind boundary (`stripUnitCells`, applied per-input by `coerceInputs`; `unitAware = true` opts a node into the algebra — perInputUnitBlind) + `applyFcUnit`'s three branches |
| `unitColumn.ts` | Per-column frame units: `ColumnUnit`, `columnUnitFromSpec`, `parseColumnUnitFromHeader` — the unitGranularity frame granularity, incl. computed columns |
| `unitFlow.ts` | Format-annotation resolver: `makeAnnotationResolver` (+ the cached `sharedAnnotationResolver` most callers use, and `resolveValueOrigin` for the popup Go-to-source walk) walks the graph: an FC locks, Convert imposes its `toUnit`, a passthrough/selector carries (data-aware), a transform breaks. BIDIRECTIONAL — `inAnnotation` (upstream FC) + `downstreamAnnotation` (an FC ahead through pure passthroughs, for boxes in front of a trailing FC) |
| `unitFormat.ts` | Unit + number-format rendering helpers |
| `formatModel.ts` | The FC control truth table (`familyOf`/`controlsFor`/`precisionApplies`) — the machine mirror of `docs/format-model.md` |
| `formatAnnotationStore.ts` | Per-socket display annotations (Format Controller writes, value boxes read) |
| `fcReconcile.ts` | Type propagation: `reconcileFcTypes` re-adapts every FC to its upstream type (shared by the Canvas connection pipe + in-place retypes); `retypeOutputCables` keeps still-valid cables + reconciles after a Cast/LAMBDA/Get Column/Note output retype |
| `trueAnyAdopt.ts` | trueany ADOPTION (wildcardLadder): every `AdoptiveSocket` port takes the wired cable's type / reverts on disconnect; outputs adopt only where honest (passthroughs, agreeing selectors). `settleWildcardTypes` = the ONE settle point, alternating this with `conduitTrace.ts`'s lane reconcile to a joint fixpoint (called by `reconcileFcTypes` + the load path, where it MUST precede FC docking — waitForTypeSettle) |
| `conduitTrace.ts` | Conduit lane type adoption: `resolveTypedSource` traces an output lane back through chained Conduits to the real source socket (cable colors); `reconcileConduitTypes` makes lanes adopt the feeding type (fixpoint). Also `conduitPath` — the whole RUN a cable belongs to (origin producer, every terminal consumer, Conduits crossed), used by the Cable inspector and double-click cable selection |
| `trigMode.ts` | `resolveTrigModes(editor)` — the ONE compute-time unit read: an Auto-mode trig `Math` node computes degrees when its input resolves to the `deg` unit, else radians (Excel parity). Run from `processGraph` before the engine pull, stamps a transient `_resolvedAngleMode`. Main-editor only |
| `noteFrontmatter.ts` | Pure parser: a Note body's YAML frontmatter → typed fields (→ NoteNode output sockets) + the markdown below the block |
| `frame.ts` | Frame value model (named typed columns) + helpers; also the Cube model (recursive cells), cached `depth`, and `relateFramesToCube`; `FrameSourceColumn` carries the column-source model (Data / Formula `expr?` / λ) |
| `computedColumnCore.ts` | THE shared computed-column row-eval core (tableRefSemantics/noPerCellFormulas): binding resolution (bare name = whole column, `@` = this row), `readRowCell`/`readWholeColumn`, side values, `tagComputedCell` — one home so the Frame Input popup and the Computed Column verb cannot disagree |
| `nodes/cube.ts` | Cube nodes: Build Cube (extensible any-cell constructor), Nest Join, Cube Columns, Cube Rollup |
| `nodes/equation.ts` + `equationSolve.ts` | The ACAUSAL Equation node (equationNode): every variable is an input AND an output + a logical Check; one unknown → solved. `equationSolve.ts` = the pure solver (symbolic AST isolation, quadratic multi-root, numeric log-grid + bisection fallback returning the smallest-magnitude root, `#SOLVE!`). `nodes/finance.ts` TvmNode/Compound Growth/Effective Rate + the pack presets subclass/lock it |
| `cubePopupStore.ts` + `components/CubePopup.tsx` / `CubeChip.tsx` / `CubeDisplay.tsx` / `cubeCell.tsx` | Cube drill-in popup (depth + breadcrumb), result-box chip + preview, per-cell rendering |
| `components/ResultDisplay.tsx` | Dispatches a result box to CubeDisplay / FrameDisplay / ValueDisplay by container kind (used by `makeNodeComponent`) |
| `chartValue.ts` / `mermaidValue.ts` | First-class FIGURE values (`__chart` / `__mermaid`) riding the green `chart` "Special" socket; a node output, embedded in Reports |
| `nodes/visual.ts` + `components/{ChartNode,MermaidNode,MermaidView}.tsx` | Visual nodes (Sparkline/Chart/Gauge/Heatmap/**Mermaid**); `MermaidView` dynamically imports mermaid.js (heavy) only when a diagram is on screen |
| `components/inlineRefDisplay.tsx` | The ONE render path for a Report/Note inline `` `=name` `` ref → live value by kind (scalar/frame/chart/mermaid/lambda-KaTeX/document — a wired Note embeds whole); `CollapsibleFigure` (Report embeds fold); `InlineRefBody` swaps `=name` code spans via imperative innerHTML + portals |
| `compositeEditorStore.ts` + `flow/FlowCompositeOverlay.tsx` + `compositeLogic.ts` | Composite drill-in, a FIRST-CLASS canvas: a breadcrumb STACK of composite instances (multi-layer, `Canvas ▸ A ▸ B`); the subgraph canvas sits IN the canvas region (`html.sol-drilled-in`) so the app chrome stays and drives it via `activeGraph.ts`; own minimap + `CompositeRunControls` panel; recompute retargets `stack[0]`; `compositeLogic.ts` = create/unpack |
| `compositeStaleStore.ts` | Which composites are STALE (a heavy run mode — goal-seek/scenarios/data-table/simulation — whose inputs/config changed since the last Solve). Drives the arm-and-run status dot; a module store because a HELD composite's output doesn't change, so processGraph's re-render pruning would skip the card |
| `presentationStore.ts` + `components/PresentationOverlay.tsx` | Presenter mode: full-screen slideshow, hides chrome (`html.solenoid-presenting`), flies the camera per step (click/Space/→/←/Esc) |
| `cxValue.ts` | Tagged complex values (tagSpecialScalars), rete-free (implReteFree) — kernels shared with the IM* formulas |
| `lambdaValue.ts` | Lambda values, rete-free (implReteFree) so the formula path runs editor-less |
| `scriptWorker.ts` + `scriptExecutor.ts` | The Script node's sandbox (decisions scriptNode): a module Worker whose only import is the app-free evaluator `nodes/scriptRun.ts`, and its main-thread client with the wall clock |
| `documentValue.ts` / `imageValue.ts` / `svgValue.ts` | The other first-class content values: a Note/Report's renderable content on a cable, images (a chart-socket sibling), inline SVG markup (never a URL — the picker hovers inner elements) |
| `valueKindLabel.ts` | value → display-kind label, one classifier for chips and popups |
| `stringOrder.ts` | The ONE string comparator (sorts and dedups share it) |
| `frameFormatStore.ts` | Per-column display-format annotations keyed `${nodeId}::${columnName}` — display only, never the column's UNIT |
| `frameHint.ts` (+`components/FrameHintLayer.tsx`) | Per-frame-input EXAMPLE hints: a node class declares a tiny sample frame; hovering the socket floats it as a mini-table |
| `locale.ts` | The single shared locale for every `toLocaleString` call |

### Relational engine (WS2/WS3 — the FrameBackend seam + verbs)
| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `frameBackend.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | The engine seam: a `FrameBackend` interface (`source`/`apply`/`join`/`append`/`collect`/`preview`/`column`/`drop`) over opaque `FrameHandle`s, so the frame layer runs on either the in-process `JsFrameBackend` (web/dev) or the **`PolarsBackend`** (desktop, over `ipcBridge`; selected by `initFrameBackend()` when `engine_ping` says `"polars"`). Also holds the node-facing **runners** `runFrameUnary`/`runFrameJoin`/`runFrameAppend` (which now return a **lazy `FrameRef`** that chains in the backend), `readFrame`/`collectPreview` (the materialization boundary — full / head-N), `flushRef` (a plan → handle, ONE `applyMany`, rebased onto the longest prefix already flushed this pass so a chain of previewing cards costs one op per card), `dropFrameRef` (lifecycle: only an empty-plan ref owns its handle), and `materialize()` (error-as-value bridge). Data crosses back at `collect`/`preview`/`column`; verb cards use `collectPreview` (head-N for a large frame); a no-op verb forwards its input as a non-owning ref (empty `drop`). `coerceInputs` collects a ref to a `FrameValue` for every consumer not in `LAZY_FRAME_NODES` (pinned complete by `lazyChain.test.ts`); consumers that need less than the frame read through `column`/`preview` instead. Module-singleton; `setFrameBackend` swaps it |
| `frameVerbs.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | The pure relational verb engine — ONE definition of each verb (FrameValue→FrameValue), shared by the JS backend's `apply`, the Polars parity oracle, and (later) the verb nodes. Unary (`applyVerb`): select/drop/rename/sort/distinct/head/filter/groupBy/pivot/unpivot; binary: join (inner/left/right/outer, fan-out, key-coalesce, null≠null), append (union-by-name); cube bridge: nest/unnest; `reconcileFrames` (two-frame key diff, surfaces blank/invalid-key rows + a PVM price/volume/mix breakdown that excludes errored cells — `reconcile.test.ts`). Reuses `compareOp` + `forAggregate` so semantics can't drift from the nodes |
| `ipcBridge.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | Web→Rust door: `engineAvailable`/`ipcInvoke`/`enginePing` (guarded by `isDesktop()`), `toSolError` maps a rejected `invoke` to a tagged `SolError`. Lazy `@tauri-apps/api/core` import → node/web-safe |
| `frameShape.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | Static frame shape: column names/types computed AHEAD of running anything, mirroring each verb's column-reshaping logic without touching row data (a mismatch with the real JS/Rust output is a caught test failure, not a silent divergence). `emptyFrameOf` is the other route — a zero-row frame a producer runs its OWN verb over. Nest/Unnest and Frame Lookup fall outside this on purpose (their outputs aren't a Frame shape) |
| `frameShapeResolver.ts` | The graph walk alone (`makeFrameShapeResolver(editor)` → `outShape(nodeId, outKey)`, memoized + cycle-guarded): resolve the input shapes, then read the producer's own `frameShape()` declaration (`nodes/frameShapeHook.ts`). Node-agnostic — it names only the Conduit lane case and reads `passthrough()` for forwarders; anything undeclared is unknown (`null`) |

### Cables

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `cablePaths.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | Path generators: walk-enumeration router (diagonal/straight), tangent-exact spline; property tests guard continuity invariants |
| `cableShape.tsx`, `CableShapeSelector.tsx` | Graph-wide shape setting + toolbar |
| `cableAngleStore.ts` | Per-socket exit-angle overrides (Conduit lanes) |
| `cableState.ts`, `cableValueStore.ts` | Hover/selection state; live per-connection values |
| `cableFlowStore.ts`, `cableFlourishStore.ts` | Flow-bead animation toggle; decorative flourish |
| `ribbonCable.ts` | Ribbon (bundled trunk + fans) membership/geometry — derived fresh per render |
| `flow/FlowCableEdge.tsx` | The cable renderer (RF edge type: hit strokes, ribbon/pill rerouting, flow-bead overlay, run selection) |
| `highlightUtils.ts` | Hover-highlight traversal, deliberately asymmetric and depth-limited: an origin lights its whole fan, a destination lights one cable |

### Renderers — the RF DOM surface + the HTML-in-Canvas gesture layer

React Flow renders everything: cards, cables, minimap, viewport. On top of it
the experimental **HTML-in-Canvas** mode (a shipped Setting, gated on
`supportsHtmlInCanvas()` — author ruling 2026-08-26: HIC is IN) draws the
captured graph to a canvas during pan/zoom gestures, hiding the RF viewport;
idle is always the real DOM. Every other renderer direction — the rete DOM
surface, the pixi spike, the WGSL/`canvas` layers — was DELETED (2026-08-09
and the 2026-08-26 cutover; git has it). Do not rebuild a third path.

| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `renderMode.ts` | Render-mode store `dom`\|`html` (default `dom`; only `html` persists) + `useRenderMode` hook |
| `htmlCanvasSupport.ts` | Gates the `html` option on `supportsHtmlInCanvas()` |
| `htmlCanvasRenderer.ts` | The HTML-in-Canvas renderer: captures the real node DOM via `drawElementImage` into mip pyramids; pan/zoom draws the canvas, idle shows the DOM |
| `components/HtmlCanvasLayer.tsx` | Mounted by FlowSurface (both canvases) over the editor/area it renders; engages when mode is `html` ≥100 weighted nodes: gesture swap (RF viewport hidden ↔ canvas), held on at rest below 40% zoom (DOM muted, selected/focused cards live), targeted re-capture per changed node id (the flowView `render` pipe), DOM-only escape hatch (conduits) |
| `hicCamera.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | world↔screen camera math (the transform `htmlCanvasRenderer` drives; the Pixi-era pan/zoom/pinch/fit helpers are deleted) |
| `hicCableGeom.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | `cablePolyline` — the app's REAL router (`getCablePath`) flattened via `pathPoints.ts`, so canvas cables match DOM cables |
| `hicGraphSnapshot.ts` | snapshots the live graph (node rects, kind colors, socket world-positions, connections) for capture |
| `hicColors.ts`, `hicSocketGlyph.ts` (+tests) | color helpers + socket-glyph classification the snapshot uses |
| `pathPoints.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | pure M/L/C/Q path → polyline flattening (`parsePathPoints`) |
| `rasterAtlas.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | the capture atlas (`packAtlas`) — one canvas read-back per paint |
| `cssColor.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | Pure CSS color parse (hex/rgb) + sRGB mixing — a canvas can't evaluate `color-mix`/`var()` |
| `domSync.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | DOM↔canvas transform sync (`camFromDrawMatrix`, viewport steering) |
| `zoomSettle.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | The gesture-exit settle window (default 420 ms; `window.__zoomSettle` override) |
| `canvasCapture.ts` | Static-export capture, deliberately separate from the live HTML-in-Canvas capture |
| `devHarness.ts` | DEV-only screenshot-comparison hooks (tree-shaken from production) |

### Groups / layout / standoffs

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `groupLogic.ts`, `groupMembership.ts` | Group create/resize/autofit; hybrid (explicit + spatial) membership |
| `groupCollapse.ts` | Visual-only collapse: retain rules, pill sockets, readouts |
| `groupPush.ts` + `groupPushCore.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | Expand-push displacement (rails/clear/cascade) + snap-back records; pure core is unit-tested |
| `standoffs.ts`, `standoffSolver.ts` (+`.test.ts`), `components/StandoffLayer.tsx` | User-declared axis-band constraints; iterative-projection solver runs after every layout pass |
| `drawnCables.ts`, `drawnCablePath.ts` (+`.test.ts`), `components/DrawnCableLayer.tsx` + `DrawnCableCapture.tsx` + `DrawnCableInspector.tsx` | Free-drawn annotation curves: the store + draw-mode store, the pure span-chaining geometry over `getCablePath`, the world-space layer ABOVE the graph, the armed tool's capture sheet, and the selected cable's shape / ends / width / head / color panel |
| `layoutInvariants.test.ts` | Seeded-PRNG property tests over the pure layout cores (`groupPushCore`'s `separateOverlaps`, a `computeExpandPush` NaN fuzz, `distributeDeltas`, `solveStandoffs`) machine-checking the "nodes/groups never overlap after a layout op" rule. `alignDeltas` is pinned per arm in `selectionOps.test.ts`; ELK Tidy integration lives in `tidyArrangeGroups.test.ts` |
| `lasso.ts`, `canvasLock.ts`, `nodeSizeStore.ts`, `collapseStore.ts`, `dockedNodeStore.ts` | Box-select, lock, per-node size/collapse, FC docking |
| `selectionOps.ts` + `components/SelectionActionsBar.tsx`/`selectionActions.css` | Align/distribute deltas (pure) + the bottom-center overlay pill (≥2 nodes selected) that surfaces them outside the Command Palette |
| `calcModeStore.ts` | Manual/automatic calculation mode + the dirty flag (`processGraph` short-circuits in manual; F9/Calculate Now forces) — persisted like Excel's per-workbook flag |
| `computeOverlayStore.ts` + `components/ComputeOverlay.tsx` | Deferred "Computing…" curtain over an irreducibly heavy pass (150 ms reveal / 350 ms min) |
| `perfProbe.ts` | Runtime perf instrumentation: `window.__solenoidPerf` per-pass node `data()` + engine IPC timings; `window.__solenoidStats()` cumulative tables |
| `nodes/placeholder.ts` | `PlaceholderNode` — what an unknown/renamed node type loads as: inert, keeps wiring + init data, re-serializes as the original type (lossless) |
| `isolate.ts` + `isolateBoundary.ts` | Isolate mode: downstream-closure focus, plus entry/exit boundary analysis for the overlay (outside output feeding a focused input = LEFT; focused output feeding outside = RIGHT) |
| `nodeSize.ts` | The ONE node-size read for layout math — never raw offsetWidth (an unpainted node reads zero and collapses the bounding box) |
| `AngleDial.tsx` (+`.css`) | The shared angle-knob control (standoff angles, Conduit rotation) |

### Catalog / menus / packs

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `nodeCatalog.ts` | The Add-menu category tree (`NODE_CATALOG`) |
| `catalogUtils.ts`, `catalogValidator.ts` | `buildCatalog` (pack insertion, dedup, prune) + dev-time consistency check |
| `nodeExcel.ts`, `excelToCatalog.ts` | Excel equivalence metadata (single source of truth) + derived maps; `EXCEL_GAP` parity list |
| `functionReference.ts`, `frStore.ts` | Function Reference overlay data (generated from the catalog) |
| `packs.ts`, `fcExtensions.ts` | Pack framework (registry/activation store, placements, `NODE_PACK_TAGS` derived from per-pack tags, FC unit/format contributions); the pack definitions themselves live in `packs/` (its own section below) |
| `AddNodeMenu.tsx`, `addMenuStore.ts`, `fuzzy.ts`, `catalogSearch.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | Right-click add menu + search; `catalogSearch.ts` extracts the scoring (per query word over label/description/Excel names/category path/keywords, one-edit typo tolerance via `fuzzy.ts`) plus the quick-wire drop filter, which memoizes each catalog type's socket signature so a drop doesn't re-`create()` every leaf |
| `excelFunctions.ts` | The single declared home for "which of the two parallel Excel implementations is authoritative for this function" (the ~150 native nodes vs Formula.js via `excelFormula.ts` `dispatch`) — per the per-family verdicts in `docs/archive/formulajs-vs-native-audit.md` |
| `excelFormula.ts` (+`.test.ts`) | The Expression/LAMBDA formula compiler (Formula.js scope); also owns the tableRefSemantics structured-reference syntax (`[Col]` whole column / `@[Col]` this row — tokenizer `colref`/`rowref` → AST `wholecol`/`atcol`) that the computed-column surfaces read |
| `formulaSignatures.ts`, `formulaSyntax.ts`, `formulaExtensions.ts`, `formulaNodeParity.ts` | The formula-surface cluster: signature metadata + syntax hints, highlighting, registered extensions, and the node↔formula parity model (`inFormula`/`excelCovered` — oneMetricImpl/oneThingPerMetric/useEveryNotSome) |
| `nodeOps.ts` | Per-class op declarations (`kind: "op" \| "argument"`) — what the Add-menu search may surface and how ops are counted; aggregator hosts are `argument` (never searchable) |
| `formulaDivergence.test.ts` | Durable CI guard for the node-vs-Formula.js divergence audit: pins every Excel-correct override (`resolveExcelFunction`) the 2026-06-25 consolidation made because FX is wrong (MOD/QUOTIENT/ATAN2/ROUND/RANK/TRIMMEAN/PERCENTRANK), plus FX-still-buggy tripwires — an FX upgrade that fixes those trips the test instead of silently re-introducing drift |

### App chrome

`TopBar`, `MenuBar`, `NavMenu` (seeds, export/import, tidy, fit), `StatusBar`,
`Header`, `AppToolbar` (accent + light/dark via `appTheme.ts`), `OutlinePanel`,
`Settings` (+`settingsStore`), `ShortcutsOverlay`, `Minimap.tsx` (the minimap
accent policy `minimapFillForNode` shared by both RF `<MiniMap>`s + the
collapse-aware `collapsedAwareNodesRect` behind NavMenu's fit-all; the
`.solenoid-minimap` window CSS both minimaps wear),
`MobileControls` (+`mobileMenuStore`, `touchSelectStore`),
`WebDemoBanner`, `CommandPalette.tsx` (+ `palette.ts`, the app palette engine
behind `PaletteEditor`/`paletteStore`), plus dialog/popup stores
(`confirmStore`, `connectionDialogStore`, `formulaPopupStore`,
`tablePopupStore` — the last also defines the LIVE-COMMIT seam:
`SourceCommitRefresh` + `onCommitSource`, produced by `FrameNodes.tsx` and
consumed by `TablePopup.tsx`, so a formula/unit pick recomputes through the
real engine and refreshes the open popup).
The HUD family stacks in `components/HudStack.tsx`: `pinStore` (pinned
values), `alertStore` (threshold fires, edge-detected on status not a
boolean), `problemsStore` (error-sink relapse tracking), `commentStore`
(node-anchored comments), `noticeStore` (the toast/warn channel — e.g. the
drill-in dropped-cable notice). Other cross-cutting toggles:
`semanticZoomStore`, `gridSnapStore`, `isolateStore`.
The rest of the chrome plumbing, one clause each: `menuModel.ts` (ONE source for the
MenuBar dropdowns AND the Command Palette, so every menubar action is a palette
command by construction), `commandRecents.ts` (MRU command labels both share),
the touch cluster (`touchActions.tsx` — one definition of the keyboard-less edit
actions; `TabletActions.tsx` — the tablet top-bar row; `coarse.ts` — the
touch-vs-mouse flags), window/boot plumbing (`chromeBottom.ts` measured bottom
envelope, `chromeToggle.ts` the chrome-collapse hotkey registry, `fullscreen.ts`,
`nativeAccent.ts` Windows 11 border sync, `devtoolsHotkey.ts` F12 in the Tauri
shell, `chunkReloadGuard.ts` the once-per-window preload-error reload),
`nodeBudget.ts` (the soft web-demo node cap), and the remaining popup/panel
stores (`outlineStore`, `shortcutsStore`, `helpDialogStore`, `chartPopupStore`,
`elementPickerStore`, `pivotEditorStore`).
The node INSPECTOR (`components/InspectorPanel.tsx` + `inspectorStore.ts`, the top
bar's (i) button): a right dock on the pinned Report's chrome pattern
(`html.sol-inspector-docked` squeezes the canvas; the two right docks are mutually
exclusive) reading the active surface's selected node: STATIC reference only — the
Function Reference derivation, real socket glyphs with `SOCKET_TYPE_LABELS`, opt-in
per-socket detail (`socketDocs.ts`, a static class map like `frameHints`), and each
declared frame-input example table (`FrameHintTable`, shared with the hover layer).
`copyCorpus.ts` is the one collector for every shipped UI string (help pages,
catalog labels/descriptions, attribute and option-table strings, seed prose),
shared by the voice lint (`uiCopy.test.ts`) and the hand-rewrite tool
(`scripts/copy-inventory.ts`, extract/apply).

### External data

`connectionStore.ts` (cached async fetch + refresh generation),
`fileBridge.ts` (Tauri fs/dialog behind an `isDesktop()` guard),
`httpBridge.ts` (proxy-aware fetch), `csv.ts` (parse/serialize),
`nodes/connection.ts` (Web Source, Local File (CSV/Parquet), Import HTML/XML),
`dataProviders.ts` + `nodes/dataFeed.ts` (the keyed data-feed providers),
`obsidianMarkdown.ts` + `obsidianWrite.ts` + `nodes/obsidian.ts` (the
Obsidian vault import/export direction).

### Node compute layer (`src/graph/nodes/`)

One file per family, pure `data()` classes: `scalar`, `list`, `listOps`,
`stats`, `dist-*`, `finance`, `financeOps`, `text`, `textOps`, `date`,
`dateSerial`, `complex`, `matrix`, `matrixOps`, `frame`, `cube`,
`tableLambda`, `lambda`, `expression`, `script` (+ `scriptRun`, `scriptCoerce`), `convert`, `convertUnits`,
`logic`, `input`, `control`,
`display`, `group`, `conduit` (block bundler), `formatController`, `composite`,
`annotation` (Note — its body's YAML frontmatter becomes typed OUTPUT sockets,
parsed by `noteFrontmatter.ts`), `report` (Report — plain-markdown sink with
`` `=name` `` inline embeds; the mirror-image counterpart to Note), `visual`
(the figure family incl. Mermaid), `surfaceFit`, `presentation`, `tornado`,
`quality` (Expect — data-quality checks, frame-cell-aware), `sink` (Write
CSV/JSON), `obsidian`, `dataFeed`, `history`, `chartOptions`, `cast`,
`coerce`, `connection`, `passthrough` (the appendLadder passthrough declarations),
`frameShapeHook` (the producer sibling: `frameShape(outKey, ctx)` + `frameShapeOf`, node-class-free),
`placeholder`, plus `shared.ts` (port factories,
broadcast + `NODE_KIND_ACCENTS`), `mathUtils.ts`, and `kind.ts` (the node → kind classifier).
Composite run modes live one level up (`src/graph/monteCarlo.ts` + `tornadoRun.ts` —
simulation / sensitivity sweeps; only the `tornado` node class is in `nodes/`), as
does `svgLayer.ts` (SVG Picker's DOM-agnostic layer hit-test). Vitest covers the math families + the
newer data-quality/report nodes (`*.test.ts` alongside; the full inventory
by category is `docs/node-coverage.md`, hand-maintained against
`nodeCatalog.ts` — nothing generates it).

### Node components (`src/graph/components/`)

One React component per node, mostly one-line `makeNodeComponent` calls
(`standardNode.tsx`). Shared kit: `nodeKit.tsx` (NodeShell, ValueDisplay,
OpSelect, InlineOutputRows), `NodeCard.tsx`, `NodeSocket.tsx`
(MeasuredSocketRow), `SocketComponent.tsx`, `inlineInput.tsx`,
`ExtensibleInputs.tsx` (flat variadic value rows, optional fixed `leadingKeys`),
`PairedExtensibleInputs.tsx` (variadic input PAIRS — IFS/SWITCH — with optional
fixed leading/trailing rows), `ArrayChip` / `TablePopup` / `FormulaPopup` (+
`popupChrome.css`), `FrameChip` / `FrameDisplay`, `SegToggle`, `SwatchGrid`, `PaletteEditor`
(F-1 app custom-palette editor, Settings-only), `DocumentProperties` (F-2
doc metadata + per-doc palette base modal), `ResizeHandle`, `RecalcButton`.
Adding a node: see the `add-node` skill /
`scripts/new-node.mjs`.

### Help (`src/graph/help/`)

In-app markdown: `help.md` (getting around), `notes.md` (concepts: frames,
live data, units), `data-model.md` + `data-types.md` (the value-model and
socket-lattice tabs) — rendered by `components/Markdown.tsx` in the Reference
overlay tabs.

### Packs (`src/graph/packs/`)

One file per pack on `packs/packShared.ts` (authoring types,
`formulaNode`/`placeFormulas`, Equation presets; a pack file may import ONLY
packShared, `../rete-nodes`, and type-only app seams — never core internals),
each with a vitest file pinning its formulas (`packs/formulaTestKit.ts`).
Framework + activation live with the catalog cluster (`packs.ts` /
`fcExtensions.ts` above); design + isolation levels: `docs/pack-architecture.md`.

### Landing & showcase (`src/graph/landing/`)

The web landing page (`LandingPage.tsx` + `LandingGraph.tsx` +
`LandingScenes.tsx`) and the dev node gallery `showcase/NodeShowcase.tsx`.

## Tauri shell (`src-tauri/`)

```
src-tauri/
├── Cargo.toml                # Crate manifest (+ fs/dialog plugin deps)
├── tauri.conf.json           # Window, identifier, build hooks
├── capabilities/default.json # Permissions: dialog + fs read/write scoped to $HOME/** + http(s) fetch + opener + window/decorum commands. Read-text also allows `.yaml`/`.yml` (mdbase schemas, bundle 24) and `fs:allow-stat` ($HOME/**) backs the Vault Folder cube's created/modified columns (`statVaultFile`); `opener:allow-open-url` is widened to `obsidian://**` for Open in Obsidian (bundle 24 D). The http scope also lists `http://localhost:*` / `http://127.0.0.1:*`: a URL pattern with no port matches only the scheme's default port, and TaskNotes serves on 8080
├── src/ipc.rs                # IPC command surface (WS1): `engine_ping` (reports backend "polars") + `IpcError` (serializes SolError-shaped).
├── src/engine.rs (+engine/tests.rs) # WS2 native Polars engine: handle table (HashMap<String, SolFrame> = DataFrame + per-column SolType tags) + the relational verbs over polars 0.46; `engine_source/apply/join/append/collect/preview/column/drop` commands. Verb parity vs the frameVerbs JS oracle runs from the shared corpus (`fixtures/frame-verbs/`, oneVerbCorpus): `corpus_cases` in engine/tests.rs + `frameVerbCorpus.test.ts` read the same wire-format fixture files.
└── src/lib.rs                # Plugin registration + `invoke_handler`: window commands (`open_devtools`, `set_window_border`, `toggle_fullscreen`) + `engine_ping` + the `engine_*` command set
```

The web layer reaches `ipc.rs` via `src/graph/ipcBridge.ts` (`engineAvailable`/
`ipcInvoke`/`enginePing`, guarded by `isDesktop()` like `fileBridge.ts`); a Rust
`Err` arrives as a tagged `SolError`. The Polars engine (WS2) is built — see
`src/engine.rs` above (the original browser-vs-desktop scoping is archived as
`archive/compute-architecture.md`). Solve/sweep now ship as COMPOSITE run modes
(goal-seek bisection/secant, scenarios, data-table, simulation — JS, arm-and-run);
there is no solver in the Rust engine itself.

## Docs (`docs/`)

## Conventions

- **One node class per family file, one component row in `nodeRegistry.ts`,
  one catalog leaf.** `constructor.name` is the persistence type key
  (`keepNames` in vite.config.ts makes it prod-stable).
- **`extractInit` allowlist** (`copyPaste.ts`; `persistence.ts` imports it): a node's
  persistent constructor fields must be listed there or they silently don't survive
  save/load/paste.
- **Module-singleton stores** for app-wide state read by cards, chrome and the
  headless paths alike (`storeKit.ts`: `createNotifier` / `createToggleStore` /
  `createValueStore` — the last is the "one nullable open/close value"
  popup-store shape), consumed via `useSyncExternalStore`. Plain React
  context/props are fine for anything local to one tree region.
- **Composability rule**: scalars → fine-grained one-op nodes; lists/tables →
  bundled task-shaped nodes with op selectors.
- **Excel metadata lives on the node** (`nodeExcel.ts`); menus and the
  Function Reference are generated, never hand-listed.
- **Stable ids** from `crypto.randomUUID()`; loads remap ids.
- Rendering/measurement gotchas (socket boxes, measured rows, async
  `area.moveNode`, pointer-event traps): `docs/subsystem-invariants.md`
