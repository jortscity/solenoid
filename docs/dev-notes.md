# Solenoid dev notes

Running notes on direction, deferred work, and non-obvious technical gotchas.
Live window: the current sessions' DIGESTS + open problems ONLY. Digested
sessions sweep verbatim to `archive/dev-notes-history.md` — read a digest here
first; drill into the archive (or `git log`) only for the mechanics of a
specific item.

### SESSION DIGEST (2026-09-07b — three agents: the Obsidian bundle lands, Track H, the Cube Input editor)

**Obsidian + TaskNotes** is the author's adoption bet (backlog § Obsidian + TaskNotes). Landed
across the three agents, ledger in the bundle doc's § What stands today: A (Vault Folder → cube),
A′ (row verbs take cubes, `recordsToCube` the one rows-of-objects → cube shape), B (Write
Properties with plan / Preview / Run + mdbase validation), C (widgets), D (Open in Obsidian, the
graph stub note + `solenoid:` backlink), E (vault watch), F (TaskNotes node: tasks / calendar /
stats; Write Tasks), F6, I, J, R5, the Weather and Holidays nodes, the headless `run-graph`
seam (`FsProvider` + `--vault` / `--tasknotes` / `--run`). Seeds: vault-as-a-table,
kitchen-remodel-tasknotes, garden-dashboard, which-task-next. **Track H**: Payoff Planner (H1),
Group Cost Settle (H3), the hours allocator seed (H3.5), Schedule (H6) over a tasks CUBE — the
author's ruling that nothing is designed around an in-cell string list. **Cube Input** is the
fourth literal source; its popup edits every level in ONE window (drill, never a popup above a
popup), and List Input got the same popup (subsystem-invariants § Literal input editors).
**Review pass** (author: "so much added, all three go and review"): the error guard now passes a
THROWN SolError through with its code (a Filter on an empty frame read `#ERROR! [object Object]`);
the Schedule catalog copy caught up with list-cell Predecessors; seed note copy fixed
(trip-split's escaped newlines, remodel-gantt's repetition). Peers' findings: be stripped agent-speak from four demo notes, made Vault Folder's folder the same subfolder dropdown Write to Obsidian uses, and the stamp (Link to graph) is now OPT-IN by the author's ruling (Preview names the `Solenoid/<doc>.md` stub when on); fe folded doubled parentheticals in Schedule / Allocator socketDocs, made Payoff's order picker a SegToggle, kept the chip on an empty Frame Input, and renumbered the seeds into group bands (Obsidian right after Start here). Open for the author: the Cube Input editor commits per cell while Table / Frame Input hold a draft with Save.

### SESSION DIGEST (2026-09-07 — Obsidian bundle 24 item A: Vault Folder → Cube)

A **demo vault** (`demo-vault/`, committed) is the single-source fixture + the author's eyeball
vault: an mdbase collection (Projects, list + nested-milestone cells), a plain Notes folder typed
via `.obsidian/types.json` + guesser, a daily-notes folder, TaskNotes-shaped tasks, People link
targets, one Bases view, wikilinks/embeds/tags. The pure-core tests read it directly (no
`tests/fixtures/vault/` mirror). **Item A shipped:** `vaultCube.ts` `notesToCube` → ONE cube, a
row per note: the Bases `file.*` built-ins + the frontmatter union; scalars typed, lists as list
cells, rows-of-objects as nested frames. Typing per key mdbase → `.obsidian/types.json` → guesser
widened across rows (`mdbaseTypes.ts` via the new `yaml` dep, `obsidianTypes.ts`, `vaultTypes.ts`);
ISO datetimes upgrade to fractional serials in the reader (kept local, noteFrontmatter untouched).
R3 `dateFromName` parses the file name into the `date` column; `dailyNotesConfig.ts` gives its
default format. `VaultFolderNode` (first cube-emitting connection node, Connections menu): desktop
-only local read (no C2 network gate), sync `data()` + a background read that walks up for
`mdbase.yaml`/`_types`, reads `.obsidian/types.json` + `daily-notes.json`, calls notesToCube;
per-node vault chip. `statVaultFile` bridge + `fs:allow-stat` / `.yaml` read for created/modified +
mdbase schemas (architecture.md desktop note). Left: the "Your vault as a table" seed (waits on
fe's A′ so the cube can Filter/Sort). Sequenced with fe (A′) and the Lead (F TaskNotes) on develop.
